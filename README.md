# 2D-Ising-Model-Monte-Carlo-Method-
This is a MATLAB Code to visualize the phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase using Monte carlo technique(Metropolis Algorithm))

Steps to RUN the MATLAB Code..............

1. To run this code just download the .m file(Ising_Shubham.m) 

2. Save it to your current directory in which you are working or just change the path of your working directory.

3. first try to run it for less no. of iterations after that increase as per your CPU speed.

4. You can extend this code to calculate various other quantities just by writting respective expression code for that quantity.

5. There is a file with basic analaysis using the plots.
